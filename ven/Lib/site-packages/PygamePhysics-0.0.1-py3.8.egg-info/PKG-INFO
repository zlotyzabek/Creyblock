Description: This project is to help with creating physics with Pygame
        Knowledge of Pygame is still required
        
        This package contains 2 modules: Collisions and Physics, you only need to worry about the physics module
        
        __init__ function:
            â€˘ This function is for creating the object. You can not use this package if you create your own Pygame rect object
            â€˘ Args- x of object, y of object, width, height, color, the window object that you would like the object to be placed on, velocity of object (Cannot be changed later on)
        
        setDimensions function:
            â€˘ Args- windowWidth, windowHeight
        
        move function:
            â€˘ Moves the object in the direction specified (up, down, left, right)
            â€˘ Args- velocity, direction
        
        setGravity function:
            â€˘ Sets the gravity for the different axis
            â€˘ Args- x gravity, y gravity
        
        keepInBounds function:
            â€˘ Keeps the object in the bounds of the screen (Called in the update function)
        
        update function:
            â€˘ Updates all of the objects' gravity and does collision resolution
            â€˘ Args- A list of all of the objects
        
        processCollisions functions:
            â€˘ Handles collision resolution
            â€˘ Args- A list of all of the objects
        
        draw function:
            â€˘ Draws the object on the window specified in the init function
        
        jump function:
            â€˘ Makes the object jump
            â€˘ Args- jump power, object_list (This can be left with a None value, it is not used
